            <p id="Bio">Hello, my name is Orlando and I am 21 years old. Some of my interests are reading books, playing
                video games, and traveling to name a few.</p>
            <p>In regards to my education, I decided to take the community college approach to save some money and get
                my gen-eds out of the way. I've earned a spot on the dean's list for my academic performance as well as
                recognigtion from the NHS Phi Thetta Kappa. I intend to enroll in a 4yr institution after my certificate
                completion and major either in Economics or Computer Science.</p>
            <p> As far as the career side of things for me, I currently hold a research internship at one of Chicago's
                oldest investment firms in the research department. Aside from that, I hope to get the experience needed
                from this
                bootcamp to
                get an
                internship at a start-up by next summer. This will be very benificial to me because this will bridge the
                gap beween my and a fortune 500 company which is my ultimate goal. Working for a start-up will show I
                know/worked in all aspects of the business on top of build up my resume. My ultimate goal is, like I
                said, to work for a fortune 500 company and work my way up towards a consultant role.</p>
